# AQI Heatmap

Welcome to the AQI Heatmap Project! This project visualizes real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data across various locations on an interactive map, highlighting PM (Particulate Matter) concentrations with clear, engaging visuals and intuitive user interactions.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Our AQI Heatmap offers a clear and interactive way to explore air quality data by clicking on locations on the map to view pollutant details. This project can be helpful for environmental researchers, students, developers, or anyone concerned about air quality and its impacts on health.

Key features include:
- **Interactive Map**: Click on any location to get detailed AQI data for PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, and O3.
- **Gradient Markers**: A visually appealing gradient marker at each location, representing air quality.
- **Detailed Popup Charts**: Hover or click on different pollutants in the chart for pollutant-specific data, rendered with smooth transitions.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views, so you can check AQI on the go.
